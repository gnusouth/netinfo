netinfo
============================

A more customisable and useful interface to my Billion modem/router (Billion 7404VNPX)

## Features
* Describe online devices with names; "Michael's laptop", instead of 04:0b:0f:32:2b:11

## Compatibility
* This probably works for a few other Billion devices. Try it out and let me know how you go.
